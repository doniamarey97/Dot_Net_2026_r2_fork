# About SSH

Using the SSH protocol, you can connect and authenticate to remote servers and services. With SSH keys, you can connect
to GitHub without supplying your username and personal access token at each visit. You can also use an SSH key to sign
commits.

You can access and write data in repositories on GitHub using SSH (Secure Shell Protocol). When you connect via SSH, 
you authenticate using a private key file on your local machine. For more information about SSH.

When you set up SSH, you will need to generate a new private SSH key and add it to the SSH agent.
You must also add the public SSH key to your account on GitHub before you use the key to authenticate or sign commits.

To maintain account security, you can regularly review your SSH keys list and revoke any keys that
are invalid or have been compromised.

If you haven't used your SSH key for a year, then GitHub will automatically delete your inactive
SSH key as a security precaution.
