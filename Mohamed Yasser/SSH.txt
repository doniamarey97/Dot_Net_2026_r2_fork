SSH key is an access credential used in the Secure Shell (SSH) network protocol to establish a secure, encrypted connection between two computers, such as a client and a remote server. It is considered a more secure and convenient alternative to traditional password-based authentication, especially for automated processes and remote server access. 

How SSH Keys Work
SSH keys operate on the principle of public-key cryptography, utilizing an asymmetric encryption scheme involving a pair of mathematically linked keys: 


Private Key: This key is a secret file that must remain securely on the user's local machine and should never be shared.
Public Key: This key can be freely shared and is placed on any remote server or service (like GitHub or cloud platforms) that the user wishes to access. It acts like a lock that only the corresponding private key can open.

Key Benefits

Enhanced Security:
SSH keys are significantly more resistant to brute-force attacks, password guessing, and credential theft compared to passwords.

Convenience: 
They enable passwordless authentication, allowing users to log in to remote systems automatically without having to enter a password for each session.

Automation: 
They facilitate the automation of secure processes, such as file transfers and configuration management, which are fundamental to modern cloud services
